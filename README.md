# Stock Price Analysis using Sentiment Score.

The present study broadens its scope to examine the relationship between news sentiment and stock prices on six prominent international stock exchanges in the crucial months of September, October, and November of 2023. Sentiment scores were computed using the Vader tool for daily news headlines pertaining to the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, Shanghai Stock Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and London Stock Exchange. This builds on the preliminary investigation of the NASDAQ index. The investigation that followed sought to determine whether sentiment scores and stock price lows in these various financial markets during the Israel Palestine war were correlated. The results of this multi-exchange strategy offer a thorough grasp of how news mood affects stock prices globally during times of geopolitical uncertainty.

## Steps

- Data Collection
For the data collection phase, the focus will be on selecting stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange, targeting a comprehensive analysis period from 2017 to 2020. This time frame ensures that the analysis covers various market conditions and trends. Gathering daily news headlines from reliable and diverse sources is essential to capture a broad spectrum of information relevant to the selected stocks. This diversity in sources helps mitigate biases and provides a more accurate representation of the market sentiment. Ensuring the reliability and diversity of news sources is critical to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the sentiment analysis.
- Vader Sentiment Analysis
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis will be utilized to evaluate the sentiment of each daily news headline. VADER is particularly suited for analyzing social media and short text, making it ideal for headline analysis. The compound sentiment score (Vh) generated by VADER ranges from -1 (strong negative sentiment) to 1 (strong positive sentiment). For each day, the daily sentiment score (St) is calculated as the average of these compound scores, providing a single sentiment measure for the day's news. This approach leverages VADER's ability to interpret nuanced sentiment expressions and punctuation intensification, offering a holistic evaluation of the overall sentiment conveyed in the news headlines.
- Correlation Analysis
The correlation analysis involves acquiring historical daily stock prices for the selected NASDAQ stocks, including high, low, close, and open prices. The Pearson correlation coefficient (œÅ) will be employed to quantify the linear relationship between the daily sentiment scores (St) and each stock price metric (high, low, close, open). The Pearson correlation coefficient provides a measure of the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables, in this case, sentiment scores and stock prices. By calculating œÅ, we can determine how sentiment influences stock price movements and identify any significant correlations that may exist during the specified time period.
- Heatmap Generation
To facilitate the interpretation of the correlation analysis results, a heatmap will be generated to visualize the correlation matrix. A heatmap provides an intuitive graphical representation of the correlations between sentiment scores and stock prices, with color coding to indicate the strength and direction of the relationships. This visual tool makes it easier to identify patterns and insights, highlighting areas of strong positive or negative correlations. By using a heatmap, the analysis becomes more accessible and comprehensible, allowing for quick identification of key relationships and trends in the data.
